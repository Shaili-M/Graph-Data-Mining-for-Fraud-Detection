# Graph-Data-Mining-for-Fraud-Detection
__Objectives__  <br> <br>
● To identify or detect suspicious fraud rings and events using graph visualization and help prevent future frauds <br>
● To verify customer identities and identify potential fraud profiles as well as profiles at risk of falling for fraudulent schemes <br>
● To learn, use and implement graph data science technology of Neo4j <br>
● To use __Neo4j GDS ( Graph Data Science )__ library to detect and label two types of fraudsters - First party fraudsters and Money Mules <br>
● To use graph mining technology and techniques for achieving fraud detection on a mobile transactions data <br>

__Scope__ <br> <br>
To reach out goal of 100% accuracy in fraud detection, we did end up creating a system that can, with enough time and data, get very close to that goal. As with any such project, there is some room for improvement here.The very nature of this project allows for multiple algorithms to be integrated together as modules and their results can be combined to increase the accuracy of the final result.This model can further be improved with the addition of more algorithms into it. <br>
However, the output of these algorithms needs to be in the same format as the others. Once that condition is satisfied, the modules are easy to add as done in the code. This provides a great degree of modularity and versatility to the project. <br>
